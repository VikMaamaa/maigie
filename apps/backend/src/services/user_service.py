    Get an existing OAuth user or create a new one.

    This function handles the OAuth user authentication flow:
    1. Looks up an existing user by provider and provider_user_id
    2. If found, returns the existing user (login scenario)
    3. If not found, creates a new user (signup scenario)
       - Checks for email conflicts to prevent account linking issues
       - Sets isOnboarded to False for new users

    Returns:

            with a different authentication method (security concern)
